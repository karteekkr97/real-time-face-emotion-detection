- üé≠ **Real-time Emotion Detection**
- üßë‚Äçü§ñ **Gender & Age Estimation**
- üìä **Live Emotion Chart (Dark Mode)**
- üé• **Webcam-Based Detection**
- ‚ö° **Fast & Lightweight**

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Git
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Steps to Install and Run
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/karteekkr97/real-time-face-emotion-detection.git
   cd real-time-face-emotion-detection
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
